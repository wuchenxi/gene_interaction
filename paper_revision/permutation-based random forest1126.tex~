\begin{abstract}
Boosted tree is a popular and highly effective method in machine learning for modeling additive models with non-linear terms. In this paper, we propose a novel gene-based, permuted, extreme, gradient boosting method called gpXGB to detect interactions between genes in qualitative traits, which has advantage in both statistical power and biological interpretability. (The main idea is to permute the genotype within each class of the dataset in two ways, one keep the interaction between genes and another remove such interactions, then rank the AUC differences of the result of XGB after these two different types of permutation.) The framework rank the interacting gene pairs by estimating the AUC difference of a XGB classification model on two test datasets through permutation that one keeping the pairwise interaction while the other removing the interaction.

\section{Introduction}

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over six thousand single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex diseases or traits. Earlier GWAS analysis strategies were largely based on single locus models, which test the association between individual markers and a given phenotype independently. Although this type of approaches have successfully identified many regions of disease susceptibility, most of these SNPs identified have small effect sizes which failed to fully account for the heritability of complex traits. Genetic interaction has been hypothesized to play an important role in the genetic basis of complex diseases and traits and to be one of the possible solutions to this problem of ``missing heritability''. Even if genetic interaction explains only a tiny fraction of ``missing heritability'', they can still provide some biological insight on the pathway level through by aiding the construction of novel gene pathway topologies.\\

The first investigations on genetic interactions have first been investigated at the SNP level, in which various statistical methods, including logic and logistic regression, odds-ratio, linkage disequilibrium(LD) and entropy-based statistic, are employed to detect SNP-SNP interactions (i.e. epistasis). Other techniques that have been used to study SNP-SNP interactions include multifactor dimensionality reduction, Tuning RelieF, Random Jungle, BEAM, BOOST\cite{1} and pRF\cite{2}. These marker-based methods may encounter some common challenges, such as the complexity arising from the large number of pairwise or higher-order tests because all pairs or groups of SNPs have to be considered; the extensive burden of multiple-testing correction they entail. (what is this) In this paper, we aim to improve the power of gene-gene interaction detection by moving beyond SNP level, and instead considering all potential pairs of SNPs from each of a pair of genes in a single gene-based interaction detection.\\

Gene-based approaches have been successful for regular GWAS tests of main (marginal) associations, and there are several potential advantages in extending this methodology to gene-gene interaction detections. Firstly, a gene-based approach can substantially reduce the number of tests needed. For example, for 20,000 genes, there are $\sim 2\times 10^8$ possible pairwise gene-based interactions to be tested, while for 3 million SNPs there are over $\sim 5\times 10^{12}$ possible marker-based interactions to be tested. Secondly, a gene-based interaction test may have greater power, because when there are multiple interactions between features in the targeted genes (or other kind of regions), the effect of these interactions may be aggregated by the algorithm. Such aggregation has already been seen in gene-based GWAS tests for main association effect. Thirdly, a gene-based approach may be better at leveraging prior biological knowledge, which is often on the level of genes. For example, one may test pairs of genes that exhibit protein-protein interactions (PPI) or that participate in the same pathways.\\


In the work of Peng et al \cite{3}, canonical correlation analysis between two genes is done on both the case and the control group, and a U-statistic, called CCU, is used to measure the difference of the correlation between these two genes, which is used to indicate the presence of interaction. A limitation of this method is that in the correlation analysis only linear relations are considered. To overcome this limitation, \cite{4,5} extended CCU to KCCU, where the canonical correlation analysis is kernelized to account for possible non-linearity. Li et al. \cite{6} introduced another method called GBIGM which is entropy-based and non-parametric, which was based on an entropy-based non-parametric. More recently, Emily \cite{7} developed a new method called AGGrGATOr which combines the p-values in marker-level interaction tests to measure the interaction between two genes. Earlier\cite{8} this strategy was successfully used for the interaction detection for quantitative phenotypes.

In this paper, rather than designing a new dedicated statistic, we use a machine learning algorithm extreme gradient boost (Xgboost \cite{9}) to propose a new approach, called gene-based permuted extreme gradient boost (gpXGB), to detect gene-gene interaction. The idea is to compare the performance of Xgboost on two different test datasets obtained from different permutation strategies, one keeping while another removing the interactions between selected gene pairs. Our method does not require explicit modeling of interacting terms and allow any kind of the functional form that interaction might take. An advantage of gpXGB is that it is nonparametric, hence may be more flexible for data-driven exploratory genome-wide association studies.
